# Deep-Sea-Boids-Behavior
Deep Sea Glow is a project that was created as a study of boids behavior and emergence. For this project, I experimented with coding the boids in order to imitate the flocking movement of different fish schools. The full video of the boids in action can be found on this <a href = 'https://www.jibleekitwattana.com/3d-works/deep-sea-glow'>page</a>.
